# AcuCycle

United States Environmental Protection Agency stated that in 2022, the United States as a whole only recycled about 67.2 million tons of a possible 267.8 million tons. AcuCycle aims to increase the amount of recycled items by making an easy way for companies to implement Recycling workflows.
